			<div>The map shown above contains the areas that I am highlighting in this guide. Below, there is a brief description of each area and what species can be seen during each season.</div>
			
			<h3>Howard and Ridout Pond [Red]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li class="season_section"><b>Spring:</b> Warblers in fairly large numbers can be seen in the trees around the ponds. Scan the shores for Northern Waterthrushes. An occasional Teal or other small diving duck might stop by on their way north.</li>
				<li class="season_section"><b>Summer:</b> Mallards and Wood Ducks can be found here regularly. Later in the summer, Spotted and Solitary Sandpipers frequently spend a few weeks feeding around the shores to fatten up for their fall migration.</li>
				<li class="season_section"><b>Fall:</b> Same as spring, but an occasional Rusty Blackbird can be found.</li>
				<li class="season_section"><b>Winter:</b> Ponds are frozen, but Black-capped Chickadees, Northern Cardinals, American Goldfinches, and occasionally other winter Finches can be seen in the surrounding trees. Check the Winter Finch Forecast for more information on what finch species to expect each year.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Bloor Street Savannah [Orange]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> Most of the likely Warblers, Kinglets, Vireos, Orioles, Flycatchers, Finches, Thrushes, Wrens can be found, as well as Scarlet Tanagers and Indigo Buntings.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b>A large family of American Goldfinches call this area home during the summer. Indigo Buntings, Chipping Sparrows, and a few woodpeckers may also be nesting here.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to Spring.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> American Goldfinches and Black-capped Chickadees enjoy the available goldenrod.</li>
			</ul>
		
			
			<h3>Behind Nature Centre [Green]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> Warblers, Kinglets, Vireos, Flycatchers, Finches, Orioles, Thrushes, and more can be seen and heard. Scarlet Tanagers enjoy stopping in the large Oak tree. If there is a large movement of migrating birds overnight, this is the place to be.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> Indigo Buntings, American Goldfinches, and Chipping Sparrows nest in the area. This is usually a great spot to see parents feeding their young in the morning.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to spring, but with lots of Sparrows (White-throated, White-crowned, Chipping, Field, Savannah, Lincoln’s, and more) in the grasses and shrubs.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> Mostly Black-capped Chickadees, White-breasted Nuthatches, and American Goldfinches spend the winter here.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Behind All Star Cafe [Dark Blue]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> The forested area east of the Tennis Courts often has a lot of migrant activity in the morning - most warblers are near the treetops there. Black-billed and Yellow-billed Cuckoos can sometimes be heard.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> Red-eyed Vireos and Eastern Wood-Pewees often have nests here. Cooper’s Hawks nest in the area as well.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to Spring. Check the tallest dead tree north of the Sumac field by the Allotment Gardens, Olive-sided Flycatchers seem to favour it when they make an appearance.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> Not much around, other than some Black-capped Chickadees, Downy Woodpeckers, and an occasional hunting hawk.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Allotment Gardens [Gray]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> Warblers, Kinglets, Sparrows, Flycatchers, and Thrushes can be seen and heard in the trees surrounding the gardens as well as in the garden plots. </li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, American Goldfinches, Indigo Buntings, House Wrens, Eastern Wood-Pewees, Great Crested Flycatchers, and more will nest in the area. Brown-headed Cowbirds will often lay their eggs in other birds’ nests here - so expect to see a few of their young being fed by other species’ adults.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to Spring. In late fall, Eastern Bluebirds stop by to feed on berries and seeds.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> Flocks of winter Finches such as Pine Siskins can be found here. Check the Winter Finch Forecast for a better idea of what finches to expect.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Behind Greenhouse [Yellow]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> Warblers, Vireos, Kinglets, Finches, Cuckoos, Orioles, Flycatchers, Thrushes - any bird that doesn’t spend most of its time in water can be found here.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> Red-bellied and Downy Woodpeckers, as well as Northern Flickers, nest along the hill. Pine Warblers have also had a successful nest here recently. Ruby-throated Hummingbirds take advantage of the small patch of wildflowers. Merlins and Cooper’s Hawks perch in the dead trees looking for a meal while being harassed by a variety of smaller birds.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to Spring, but much more quiet.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> These paths are not maintained in the winter, so there could be a lot of ice. Many friendly Black-capped Chickadees, Red and White-breasted Nuthatches, Downy Woodpeckers, and Northern Cardinals. Winter Wrens can be skulking through the fallen leaves and snow.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Upper Duck Pond [Purple]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> Mainly Mallards and Wood Ducks until the songbirds return. Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, Warblers, Vireos, and Kinglets populate the trees surrounding the pond. Rose-breasted Grosbeaks visit the forested area on the eastern side frequently.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> Great Blue Herons, Black-crowned Night Herons, and Great Egrets will put on a great show almost every day here. A Green Heron can be spotted from time to time. Blue-gray Gnatcatchers nest in the surrounding trees. Eastern Kingbirds frequently nest on the middle island. A Belted Kingfisher may also make an appearance, but they seem to prefer the Lower Duck Pond.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to Spring.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> The pond is usually frozen, but a few ducks may be lingering here if the weather is warmer.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Lower Duck Pond [Black]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> Single American Coots and Pied-billed Grebes will mingle with the Mallards and Wood Ducks. Songbirds tend to stick to the trees in the south-west corner of this pond.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> Mallard and Wood Duck numbers multiply here in the summer. A Belted Kingfisher or two can be perched up in the taller trees on the western shore. In those same trees, Great Blue Herons and Great Egrets can be found basking in the sun. Black-crowned Night Herons will be tucked into shady spots along the shores. Later in the summer, an Osprey can fish in the pond as well.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to Spring.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> Usually frozen, but some winter ducks could be found.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Grenadier Pond (South) [White]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> Gadwalls, Greater and Lesser Scaups, Ring-necked and Ruddy Ducks, as well as other diving and dabbling ducks can be seen swimming and feeding in the southern half of the pond.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> Tree, Barn, and Northern Rough-winged Swallows as well as Chimney Swifts will feed just over the surface of the pond. Purple Martins have been using the nest house at the south edge of the pond. An occasional Common or Caspian Tern may visit from the Lakeshore to do a few laps searching for fish.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to Spring.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> Before the pond freezes, Common, Red-breasted, and Hooded Mergansers, Buffleheads, and Lesser and Greater Scaups are usual visitors. Once the pond freezes for the winter, some geese, swans, and gulls may still be found on the ice.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Grenadier Pond Marsh (North) [Light Green]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> A good mix of all species can be seen during migration here. Songbirds like to feed in the fallen, but still living, trees that lean into the water. Shorebirds like Spotted and Solitary Sandpipers or Greater and Lesser Yellowlegs may stop by if there is enough exposed mud. Some secretive marsh birds, like Rails and Bitterns, can rarely be heard calling from the reeds.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> Many Herons, Mallards, and Wood Ducks around. Nesting Red-winged Blackbirds make a constant racket, and may also swoop at you. Baltimore Orioles raise their young on the eastern hill. Recently, there has been a possible breeding pair of Marsh Wrens. In late Summer, Ospreys like to perch in the trees on the western side of the pond.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Similar to Spring.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> This is typically where the over-wintering ducks will spend their time (Mallards, Wood Ducks, and possibly some Mergansers)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Hawk Hill [Light Blue]</h3>
			<iframe class="heatmap" src="maps/park_areas_map.html" height="500" width="80%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no" title="All birds heatmap"></iframe>
			<ul class="map_area">
				<li><b>Spring:</b> A few migrants can be found here, but not as many as the rest of the park. Eastern Towhees and some skulking warblers along with the groups of other birds can be found around the hill.</li>
				<li><b>Summer:</b> House Wrens, Indigo Buntings, and American Goldfinches nest here. Lots of wildflowers to see as well.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Participate in the High Park Hawk Watch! From September 1st to November 30th, there will be most of the raptors you could expect to see! Watch for cloudy days with North or North-West winds.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> Mostly a hunting area for the local Red-tailed and Cooper’s Hawks.</li>

				<li><b>Summer:</b> House Wrens, Indigo Buntings, and American Goldfinches nest here. Lots of wildflowers to see as well.</li>
				<li><b>Fall:</b> Participate in the High Park Hawk Watch! From September 1st to November 30th, there will be most of the raptors you could expect to see! Watch for cloudy days with North or North-West winds.</li>
				<li><b>Winter:</b> Mostly a hunting area for the local Red-tailed and Cooperâ€™s Hawks.</li>

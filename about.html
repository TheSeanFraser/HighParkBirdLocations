			<h3>About Project</h3>
			<p>This is a project that I started in July of 2021, although I had been thinking about starting this for a long time.</p> 
			<p>I am interested in finding patterns in the locations each species of bird that can be seen in High Park, as well as providing a resource for other birders to help them see everything that I can find.</p>
			<h4>Data Collection</h4>
			<p>I have created a Python application to import my eBird checklists to record the GPS location and surface where each bird is seen (air, water, ground, tree, structure) to an SQL server.
			</p>
			<h4>Data Visualisation</h4>
			<p>Using the ipyleaflet jupyter widget, I create a map for the observations of each species and each checklist.</p>
			<h4>eBird</h4>
			<p>You can find my <a href="https://ebird.org/profile/MTE4NTQ3Mw/world">eBird profile here</a> (must be logged in to eBird to view).</p>
